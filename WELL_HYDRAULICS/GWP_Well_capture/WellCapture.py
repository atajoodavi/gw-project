    This app is designed to introduce the computation of the well capture zone. 
     
    In a contaminated aquifer, contamination within a well capture zone will ultimately reach the well as presented conceptually in the figure below. The Well Capture interactive tool calculates the capture area for a pumping well in a confined, homogeneous, isotropic aquifer with the following properties entered by the user.
    - hydraulic conductivity _K_ (meters per second)
    - pumping rate _Q_ (cubic meters per second)
    - regional hydraulic gradient of groundwater flow _i_ (dimensionless)
    - aquifer thickness _b_ (meters)
    
    Additional inputs allow the user to reformat the graph that displays a plan view of the capture zone. The calculated values of the culmination point and the maximum width of the capture area are printed below the graph.
