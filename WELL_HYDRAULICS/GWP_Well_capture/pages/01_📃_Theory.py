    ## The Conceptual Model for WellCapture
    A well capture zone (or capture zone) is an area within an aquifer that delineates groundwater that will ultimately reach the well. It is also referred to as the zone of contribution. In a contaminated aquifer, contamination within a well capture zone will eventually reach the well as presented conceptually in the figure below.
    
    The WellCapture interactive tool calculates the capture area for a pumping well in a confined, homogeneous, isotropic aquifer. The regional groundwater flow is directed along the x-axis with a hydraulic gradient i. Accordingly, the capture area of an ideal pumping well, situated at the coordinates (0,0) can be characterized by the culmination point and the maximum width of the zone within the flow divide.
