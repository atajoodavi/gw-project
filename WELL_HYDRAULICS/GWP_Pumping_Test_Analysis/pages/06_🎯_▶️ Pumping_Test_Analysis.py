            This application allows you to choose the :red[Theis], :green[Hantush-Jacob], or :violet[Neuman] model to estimate aquifer properties by matching the curve to drawdown data measured during one of a number of pumping tests. 
            
            Alternatively, you can use your own data by uploading them as a *.csv file. The required data format is time in minutes separated by a comma from drawdown in meters.
