            The mathematics included in this application consider only homogeneous and isotropic aquifers. Natural aquifers are not homogeneous nor isotropic (although they come close to isotropic in most instances). Consequently, in practice, the procedures presented in this application are applied to heterogeneous and anisotropic aquifers to glean average parameter values that are representative of bulk behavior of the system. The aquifer can be confined, leaky, or unconfined. 
            
            When a well pumps water out of an aquifer, water flows radially toward the well.
            
            The following 2-minute video provides a conceptual overview of pumping tests for different aquifer conditions (i.e., an aquifer that is fully confined, an aquifer receiving water via leakage through an aquitard, and an aquifer receiving water from both storage in and leakage through an aquitard.

            The radial groundwater flow equation can be used to describe hydraulic head at a time $t$ and distance $r$ from a pumping well.

If you are interested in manual type-curve matching, you can find another application that provides all required materials and guidance at [https://theis-manual.streamlit.app/](https://theis-manual.streamlit.app/). The Cooper-Jacob straight-line methods are simplified analytical approaches derived from the Theis solution and are commonly used for estimating aquifer parameters from late-time drawdown data. While widely applied in practice, these methods are not covered in this application. A future application that covers advanced methods for pumping test analysis will account for the Cooper-Jacob straight line methods.

            The following information is a short excerpt from IAH's The Hydrogeologist Time Capsule (https://timecapsule.iah.org/).
            
            _... In 1935, Charles V. Theis published a brief article that was the first transient solution for groundwater flow toward a well. He did so by understanding the vital analogy between groundwater flow and heat transfer. As John Bredehoeft says: "It takes real genius to see the basic form of the underlying theory ‚Äì this was Theis‚Äôs contribution". Today, the Theis transient pump test solution is used by all hydrogeologists for well test interpretation. It is one of the many consequences of his discovery. Theis's legacy is not limited to the transient theory. He was one of the first scientists to emphasize the importance of geological heterogeneity._

            In the years following publication of Theis's equations, the practice of plotting field measurements of drawdown over time during a pumping test on graph paper and matching it to a type curve to estimate transmissivity $T$ and storativity $S$ is a time-tested hydrogeological method.
            
            **Today**, rather than physically plotting data on paper, we use **computer codes** to match the data to the type curve because it is easier and more convenient. 
            
            Nevertheless, **it is best practice to view the data in graphical form whether it is plotted by hand or by a computer** because the shape of the curve provides insight to the nature of the groundwater system and sometimes plotting the data reveals errors in the data.

    """   
    #### Limitations of the Theis solution
    While the **Theis solution** has been widely used for analyzing pumping tests in confined aquifers, it is based on **the following assumptions that limit its applicability**.
    - The aquifer is 
        - infinite in lateral extent,
        - homogeneous,
        - isotropic, and
        - fully confined.
    - The aquifer response to removal of water from the well bore is instantaneous.
    - The well bore is infinitesimally small.
    - The well fully penetrates the aquifer.

    Unlike the pristine system described by the Theis equation, many aquifers are leaky, allowing water exchange with adjacent layers, or they are unconfined, or exhibit anisotropy and heterogeneity. The Theis Solution does not account for these complexities.
    
    #### Extensions of the Theis Solution to overcome its limitations
    
    To address these limitations, **Hantush and Jacob (1955)** developed a solution that extends the Theis model of flow in a fully confined aquifer to flow in a leaky aquifer. This represents leakage from an over- or under-lying aquifer through an aquitard that does not store water, allowing for analysis in regions where semi-pervious aquitards are present.
    
    Further refinements were made by **Neuman (1972)**, who introduced a solution that accounts for the delayed decline of water level in unconfined aquifers. Also, although not included in this application, Neuman developed solutions for flow to partially penetrating wells for the delayed observation of aquifer drawdown due to removal of water from wellbore storage. 
    
    These developments represent significant advancements beyond the Theis solution, enabling interpretation of pumping test data in a wider range of hydrogeological settings.
