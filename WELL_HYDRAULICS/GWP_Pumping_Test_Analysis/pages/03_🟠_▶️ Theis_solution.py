            The Theis (1935) solution was developed to calculate drawdown due to pumping a confined aquifer. Please note: The assumption of a uniform potentiometric level before the start of pumping, as shown in the subsequent figure, is not required. Indeed, natural systems typically have some hydraulic gradient. This background level may even change over the duration of a test. Therefore, the analyst must identify the changes in water levels caused only by pumping (i.e., drawdowns).
            
            This application uses the Theis Solution to estimate Transmissivity $T$ and Storativity $S$ from drawdown data collected during a pumping test. 
            
            You can estimate $T$ and $S$ by adjusting a slider or by typing a number (depending on the toggle switch position) to modify the values of $T$ and $S$ until the measured data align with the Theis curve for the input parameters.

            In this section, you can **adjust the values of transmissivity and storativity until the calculated curve of drawdown versus time using the input values of $T$ and $S$ matches the ideal drawdown data**. The ideal data represent drawdown at a distance of 120 m from a well pumping 0.005 m¬≥/s.
            
            A close match indicates that the selected values are a reasonable representation of the aquifer properties.
            
            Additionally, you can **switch between a log-log and a semi-log plot** to analyze the effect of transmissivity and storativity values on the drawdown behavior. The semi-log plot is useful for visualizing that late-time drawdown-versus-time data from a confined aquifer form a straight line on a semi-log graph.
            
            More precise matching can be achieved by **zooming in** and/or by using **typed number input rather than slider input**. Both are selected with a toggle switch.
            
            The **scatter plot** can be turned on by using a toggle switch. It provides a visual comparison of the data and the fitted curve. A 45-degree line indicates a perfect match between the measured drawdowns and those calculated by the Theis solution for the input values of $T$ and $S$.

            - It is generally **not possible to maintain an absolutely constant pumping rate** so the data do not form a completely smooth curve.
            - **Water is removed from the well bore in the early period of pumping**, but that phenomenon is not accounted for by the Theis solution which assumes an infinitesimal well diameter and thus instantaneous response of head in the aquifer to pumping of the well, so drawdown may be unexpectedly large and rapid at early times while water is removed from the bore.
            - **Aquifers are not laterally infinite** as assumed in the Theis solution, rather there may be bodies of surface water near the well that provide water to the system, slowing the rate of drawdown, or  there may be low permeability materials such as bedrock or faults that prevent water flow toward the well from some directions causing drawdown to occur more rapidly than calculated by the Theis Solution. These are referred to as "boundary effects" and noticeable in data from later in the pumping test.
            - **Other stresses on the groundwater system may influence groundwater levels** such as pumps in nearby wells being turned on or turned off, causing either more rapid drawdown or slower drawdown (and sometimes even result in water levels rising). An interesting example of the effect of other stresses occurred during the test of a well in an alluvial aquifer near a river being conducted by an instructor to provide example data for a class exercise - the drawdown was proceeding, but even though the pumping rate was constant the water levels began to rise as the sun began to set. The cottonwood trees along the river had been "pumping water" by way of evapotranspiration all day while the well was pumping. The evapotranspiration stopped as the sun went down decreasing the withdrawal of water from the aquifer, thus water levels rose. The evapotranspiration was such a powerful influence on the water levels that the data were not useful for a first-level class exercise.

            While adjusting parameter values, **one finds that the early-time drawdown data can be matched very well to the Theis curve, but the data do not fit well at later times**. The reason for this behavior is that as the drawdown cone grows in depth and extent, leakage through an aquitard enters the aquifer which slows the rate of drawdown. At that time the underlying assumptions of the Theis solution are no longer met. The $T$ and $S$ values used to match to the early time data to the Theis curve provides representative values of $T$ and $S$ because the leakage is so insignificant at early time that the assumption of a fully confined aquifer is reasonable.
